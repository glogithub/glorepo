# Racluster Aggregation Policy Configuration
#
# Carter Bullard
# QoSient, LLC
#
#   This configuration is a racluster(1) flow model configuration file.
#
#   The concept is to bind a traditional ra* filter with an
#   aggregation model.  Records are tested against the filter
#   specifications in "fall down" order, when they match, the
#   aggregation model is used to merge records together.  The model
#   supports hold and idle timers in order to control the holding
#   merging strategies.  If reading from a file, the times are
#   determined from timestamps in the input stream.  The system
#   works best if the input stream is somewhat sorted in time.
#
#   Here is a valid and simple configuration file.   It doesn't do
#   anything spectacular, or special, but it is one that has been
#    used at some sites.
